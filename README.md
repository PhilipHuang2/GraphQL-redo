# GraphQL-Redo
This project involved taking a Full Stack Restful website and refactoring it to use GraphQL.  It was interesting looking at an entire website and deciphering what parts went where and mapping out the import chaining.  One issue I have was figuring out the authorization.  I had alot of troubles with that and looking into the documentation was troubling.  I am not completely sure if my method was correct.
